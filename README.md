# daily_reps
a repo specifically created to encourage the habit of problem solving code

Code challenges will be pulled from leetcode, hackerrank, codewars, etc. and worked through in a Jupiter notebook for ease of commenting and documenting thought processes.

In efforts to keep the repo somewhat orderly, the challenges will be logged here and then solved in a notebook organized by year/week_number
